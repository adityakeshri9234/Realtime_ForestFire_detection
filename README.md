Realtime Forest Fire Detection

Overview
Wildfires are among the most destructive natural disasters, causing extensive ecological, economic, and social damage. This project aims to provide a robust, real-time forest fire detection and prediction system using a hybrid deep learning framework. By integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the system predicts wildfire spread with a focus on efficiency and accuracy.

Key Features
Hybrid Model Architecture: Combines CNN (MobileNetV2) for spatial feature extraction and RNN (LSTM) for temporal analysis.
High Accuracy: Achieves an accuracy of 97.2% and precision of 82.1% for fire region detection.
IoT Integration: Designed for real-time monitoring using IoT-enabled sensors.
Data Augmentation: Includes techniques like random cropping and center cropping for robust training.
Scalability: Lightweight and adaptable for diverse geographical locations and environmental conditions.
